I am (as of Fall 2023) a postdoc in the <a href="https://jluastro.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MULab/overview">Moving Universe Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. In the Summer of 2023, I completed my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics at Penn State. My current research is focused on gravitational microlensing, and in particular, the search for stellar mass black holes in the Milky Way. My past research topics have been: microlensing searches for exoplanets, star and brown dwarf formation, and the search for technosignatures (or SETI).

### Current Projects
- Primary project: Astrometric follow-up of long-timescale microlensing events to search for stellar mass black holes in the Milky Way (papers in progress)
- Developing/maintaining the <a href="https://github.com/synthpop-galaxy">SynthPop</a> population synthesis Galactic modeling code (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/adcd7a/meta">Kluter & Huston et al. (2025)</a>)
- Preparing for microlensing science with the upcoming Roman Space Telescope (<a href="https://rges-pit.org/">RGES PIT</a> member)
- Chairing the Galactic Science Working Group of the La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ae02c5">LS4</a>), which began observations in late 2025
